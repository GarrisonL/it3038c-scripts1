//Random Generator Script
//My script uses the random module in three different instances to display a random number between 1 and 25, 
// 5 different floats and picks a random food from the list provided in my script code.

You can run the script by navigating to the script location if your doing so via commandline or
 simply run the file in an app such as Visual Studio.

 Thanks.
